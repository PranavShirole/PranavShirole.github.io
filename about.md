Hello, I'm Pranav Shirole, and this is my Data Science blog. I am an amateur data scientist and machine learning engineer, with experience in Python and SQL. I specialize in Data Wrangling, Data Visualization, and Machine Learning techniques. I have a background in Engineering and Statistics, Web Development, and UI/UX Design. I also hold a Master's degree in Industrial Engineering.

This is my way of showcasing my data science skills and the related projects I have worked on. Please feel free to reach out to me in case you would like to work together.
