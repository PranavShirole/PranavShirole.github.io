Hello, I'm Pranav Shirole, and this is my Data Science blog. I'm a data science and machine learning enthusiast. I taught myself about artificial intelligence concepts and deep learning frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow, with previous experience in Python and SQL. I have a background in Engineering and Statistics, Web Development, and UI/UX Design. I also hold a Master's degree in Industrial Engineering from Clemson University.

This is my way of showcasing my data science skills and the related projects I have worked on. You may use the "Tags" link in the navigation to get an overview of the tools and techniques used in the projects. You can also use the Search Box to look for specific keywords that might interest you, so as to narrow down your search. Please feel free to reach out to me in case you would like to work together.
